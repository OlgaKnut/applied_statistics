    "2. Normality:  \n",
    "- The data in each group should follow a roughly normal distribution.  \n",

    "- If this assumption is violated, a variation of the test, known as Welch’s t-test, can be used.\n",

    "**Summary**  \n",
    "The t-test is a versatile statistical test used for comparing means. It works by calculating the t-statistic, which determines how extreme the observed difference is under the null hypothesis.

    "When analyzing more than two groups, it is generally more appropriate to use ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) instead of performing multiple t-tests for the following reasons:  \n",
    "1. Control of Type I Error Rate  \n",
    "- Each time a t-test is performed, there is a chance of making a Type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true). The probability of at least one Type I error increases as you perform more tests.  \n",
    "- For example, with a significance level (α) of 0.05, the chance of making at least one Type I error when comparing multiple pairs of groups grows quickly:  \n",
    "Overall Type I error = $1 - (1 - \\alpha)^k$  \n",
    "where 𝑘 is the number of tests. For 3 groups (comparing all pairs), you would need 3 t-tests, and the overall error would be larger than 0.05.  \n",
    "- ANOVA avoids this issue by testing all group means simultaneously under one overall null hypothesis:  \n",
    "$Ho$: All group means are equal.  \n",
    "and alternative hypothesis  \n",
    "$𝐻𝑎$: At least one group mean is different.  \n",
    "By using a single test, ANOVA controls the Type I error rate at the desired significance level.  \n",

    "- Performing multiple t-tests involves redundant comparisons and more calculations. ANOVA is a more efficient, streamlined way to analyze multiple groups in a single test.  \n",
    "- ANOVA provides a single overall F-statistic that determines whether group means are significantly different without requiring pairwise testing.  \n",
    "3. Interpretation of Results  \n",
    "- ANOVA provides a clear framework to test for overall differences among groups, rather than focusing on individual pairwise comparisons.  \n",
    "- If the ANOVA result is significant (rejecting the null hypothesis), post-hoc tests (e.g., Tukey's HSD or Bonferroni correction) can be used to identify which specific group means are different while still controlling for Type I error.\n",
    "4. Assumptions Are the Same  \n",
    "ANOVA and t-tests share similar assumptions:  \n",
    "- Independence of observations  \n",
    "- Normally distributed data within groups  \n",
    "- Equal variances among groups (homogeneity of variance)  \n",
    "**Conclusion**  \n",
    "Using ANOVA instead of multiple t-tests prevents the inflation of Type I error, improves computational efficiency, and simplifies interpretation. It tests for overall differences among groups in a single test and allows for follow-up comparisons (post-hoc tests) only if necessary. This makes ANOVA the preferred method when comparing more than two groups."
